				<p>Hello, my name is Paul. I like computers and <strong>mushrooms</strong>.</p>

				I am also interested in the philosophy of HCI. Some nights I lay awake thinking about questions like: 
				<ol>
					<li>What exactly are computers doing to our consciousness when we use this? Sometimes I feel the more I use computers, the more I become one. </li>
					<li>How do computers manipulate and persuade us into spending hours on apps like Facebook or Instagram? </li>
					<li>What if everything is just a simulation? Would this explain all the bain vs. computer analogies?</li>
				</ol>

				<p>
				When I complete this class, I hope to have a practical understanding of HCI so that I can be useful in the tech workforce. I would also like to have a general understanding of HCI. 
				</p>
				<p>
				As for my technical skills, I am most proficient programming in Javascript and Java. Also, I am also very comfortable working with SQL and PHP. Regarding frameworks, I have built projects with Node.js, CakePHP, Processing, and Web Selenium.
